# About Me

I am a software engineer by trade. Sometimes, I have thoughts. Occasionally, I write about my thoughts.

I am available for mentoring, particularly for individuals looking to get started in software engineering careers.

# About Website

This website is written using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. I'm using my own theme, with colors generated by [Coolers](https://coolors.co/).

I'm using [Pure](https://purecss.io/) for responsive CSS. The layout of the blog is shamelessly lifted from Pure's [blog layout](https://purecss.io/layouts/blog/).

I use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check my spelling and grammar in posts.
