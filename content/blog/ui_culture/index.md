# Culture Workshop

The culture and values of an organization or team are tremendously important.
They inform how (and whether) a team functions and govern interactions amongst
team members and outsiders.

While there are innumerable writings on why culture and values are important, as
well as how to change them, it’s difficult to find tactical information about
how to enumerate the culture of an organization or group.

As the engineering team at United Income has grown and team members have
changed, we realized that we’d never been explicit about communicating our
values and how they inform our team culture. In early 2019, as we began planning
to grow the team, we thought it would be useful to make our culture and values
more explicit. Unfortunately, we weren’t sure where to start.

We did know for one thing that part of our culture is our innovation sprints.
Each quarter, we stop our normal work for a week to focus on fun projects that
may only be tangentially related to the company. For our second innovation
sprint of 2019, we decided to spend some time as a team reflecting on our values
and culture.  Two engineers designed and facilitated a half-day workshop, but we
relied on participation from the entire team to complete this work.

## Culture vs Values

We have a lot of fun at United Income — whether in our innovation sprints, our
team lunches, or around our cold brew, nitro coffee. While this contributes to
our culture, we felt it was foundational to differentiate key terms.

We developed the following illustration to help people think about culture and
how it comes into existence.

{{< imgproc what-is-culture.jpg >}}

In this image, culture is an amorphous blob given shape by the people in our
organization, the values of those people, the values of the organization, and,
to a lesser extent, our events, perks, and rituals. The analogy illustrates both
what culture it is and how it forms. It also illustrates how culture can change
over time, especially as new people with new values are added to a group.

We also like this analogy because it sets valuable guardrails for our
discussion. Culture is emergent and fluid; we can’t strictly define it or force
it into some perfect ideation. But, by focusing on what we can define, we have
the ability to shape it into something we find desirable.

That’s why we focused on values.

## Team Buy-In

Our team had been around since 2016 and a strong culture had already developed,
reinforced by largely unspoken values. While there are always areas to improve,
we generally like those values and we believe they serve us well. We have
minimal churn in our engineering team, we get a lot of work done, and we enjoy
working together.

{{< imgproc buy-in.jpg >}}

Values are often defined from the top of an organization, but our team wanted to
give voice to our existing values. We needed a transparent and collaborative
process to extract and define what would become our spoken values.

Involving the whole team was important to us for three reasons.

1. We value the diverse perspectives of our team and wanted to hear opinions
   from everyone.
2. We wanted the whole team to feel a sense of ownership over the values.
3. We wanted to make sure that everyone on the team understood what each value
   means in the context of the United Income Engineering team.

This last point warrants some extra examination. Typically, the cultural values
of a team are expressed as either a single word or a pithy phrase — “ownership”
or perhaps “we have each other’s backs”. These short expressions of a value are
useful to those who have an existing understanding of how that value is
expressed in the organization. If two people on a team have a different idea of
how a value is to be expressed, the end result is confusion and contradiction,
which we hoped to avoid.

## Process

We designed a half-day workshop that brought together our whole engineering team
to engage in a structured discussion on culture. We scheduled a breakfast
meeting to accommodate a remote team member in Germany (our main offices are in
Washington, D.C.) and enticed everybody to show up on time with our traditional
Innovation Sprint breakfast — McDonalds.

To get the team thinking about culture and values, we passed out a printed
worksheet the day before the workshop. We let the team know that we weren’t
going to collect it, but encouraged everyone to think about the questions. We
asked:

* What makes you feel most excited to come to work every day?
* When do you feel like things are going well at work?
* Reflecting on your experiences at United Income, at what time or during which
  project do you feel like you’ve grown the most and why?
* Do you think our team works well together? Why do you think that is?
* When interviewing, what do you feel are the best indicators that this person
  belongs here?
* What do we all hold in common?

During our meeting, we explained why we were thinking about culture and values
now, outlined our definition of culture and values, and briefly discussed the
established company values. After this presentation, we moved into interactive
sessions. First, we took a deep-dive into some case studies from other
companies. We followed the case studies by asking small groups to brainstorm
potential values for our team.

{{< imgproc process.jpg >}}

We believe that the success of the workshop relied on a high degree of
interactivity in the small groups. Each group led their own discussion, took
their own notes, and presented their own findings to the larger group. In order
to ensure groups stayed on topic and didn’t go too far over their allotted
times, we paired each group with a facilitator from engineering leadership. We
briefed the facilitators the day before the workshop to avoid lecturing and to
let the group come to its own conclusions.

### Case Studies

While planning the workshop, we researched dozens of other companies and their
values. As facilitators, we identified a set of companies that we felt
represented different takes on values. We used these as case studies to explore
how we might think of our own values.

We focused the discussion on the following topics:

* Initial thoughts on the writeup
* Formatting
* Whether the values useful for hiring
* Values people particularly liked/disliked.

As a full group, we started by examining one company’s values to model smaller
group discussions. We chose our example because it was particularly verbose and
strongly opinionated, lending itself well to a discussion.

After modeling the discussion, we split the team into three moderated groups for
individual case studies. When we re-joined, one member from each smaller group
presented the group’s summary of the case study.

### Values

After the case studies, we broke up into different small groups and each group
brainstormed a list of 5–10 values. We wanted a combination of values they would
like to see, as well as values they currently see evidenced in our culture.

Again, each group selected a presenter to explain their values and provide
enough context that other groups could understand them.  There were a lot of
commonalities among the groups. This isn’t surprising — as a small team, we
began this exercise with the understanding that we share a lot of values. Some
of the values are part of our culture currently, but there were a number of
important values that groups felt are not clearly visible in our culture.

## Synthesis

After the workshop, we sat down to take the lists of proposed values from the
groups, pull out similar values, and flesh out what those values look like for
our team. We initially pulled out five values that were common to each group.

We also discussed these values one on one with each member of the team. During
these discussions, we fleshed out what each value encompasses. We also
considered adding a new value, which seemed to pop up as an underlying theme for
several of our original five. Each team member added additional depth and color
to our understanding of the five values we selected.

After discussing the values with the team individually, we created a written
paragraph for each value. In our writeups, we attempted to answer the following
questions:

* What is the value?
* Why is it important?
* What does it look like at United Income?

We put the write ups in a GitHub repository so we could collect comments and
invite some discussion. We chose GitHub because we wanted a record of the
discussion, as well as any resulting clarification.

## Reflections

Overall, we were satisfied with this process for refining and expressing our
values. We came to a clear understanding of the values, and were able to
identify whether some values shared among many team members were not
well-reflected in our current culture.

We had a number of additional reflections that we didn’t feel fit anywhere else
in this writeup, so they’re all in a rough jumble in this appendix.

### Facilitation

Part of the reason we felt the workshop was successful was the high level of
engagement in both the small and large group discussions. We think it’s
important that every member of the team speaks during the workshop.

### Further Action

While we haven’t gotten to this yet, we’d like to revisit these values once or
twice a year and make sure they still ring true. We’d also like to provide an
anonymized library of stories demonstrating the values, and perhaps even of
stories where we failed to live up to our values.

### Time Allotted

We originally planned for a two and a half hour meeting for the workshop. The
team was very engaged in the discussions, so we decided to extend the meeting an
additional half hour. Even at that point, we were still having fruitful
conversations and likely could have used additional time.  While we attempted to
keep discussions on topic, we often misjudged how engaged the team would be and
adjusted our facilitation accordingly. We think having designated facilitators
was vital, but we imagine that every team will require a different amount of
time for a similar workshop, so our duration numbers are really just a rough
estimate.

### Reference Material

We selected the following company’s value blog posts to use as source material
for our workshop. Each of these write ups have very different style and
presentation, as well as slightly different values. We are fortunate to live in
a time when the internet is full of examples, so we do recommend doing your own
survey of source material if you are interested in running such a workshop.
